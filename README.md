# Prophetess
 Telegram bot that helps with observations.
 
 Originally made to predict transits, visibility and send custom alerts of TESS targets.
 Currently relies so heavily on astroplan that seems to be a wrapper of astroplan for Telegram :)
 Some functions may not be 100% implemented and there should be a lot of bugs. Most of the updates will depend on my needs for the moment.
 Eventually will cover general use tasks for observational astronomers.
 
## Required libraries
 -python-telegram-bot
 -astroplan
 -astropy
 -emoji
 -numpy
 -matplotlib
 
## Installation
You should create an 'auth.py' file which contains a variable token with your Telegram Bot token in string format. Then just run 'main.py' and start interacting.
